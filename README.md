I was wondering the advantage of home field advantage in the playoffs and the most important factor in victory.  This is still an ongoing project.  

For home field advantage in the playoff for the last 11 years you can see on the Power BI visualvthat the home team has a better winning percentage through out all the rounds, which improves the further you go in the playoffs.
I added a slider to show the records in each round.

The second part of this project was to determine, what is the biggest variable in winning.  If you teams scores a defensive or special teams touchdown that will give you around an 80% change of winning the game.
I also added a matrix to show,, which teams were able to over come giving up a defensive\special teams touchdown.

The last visual shows the total team victories and the total number of home and away winds in the playoffs
